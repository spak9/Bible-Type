<h1>Bible Type</h1>
<p>Thanks for visiting Bible Type!</p>
<p>
    Bible Type was a project that began as a small nugget
    of an idea as I was thinking about fun projects to
    pursue on my free time during my 4th year of undergrad.
    Although I really enjoyed the "ordinary" CS curriculum,
    I was quite bothered by my inability to create any
    application from scratch, so I decided to dip my
    toes into some basic web development and see what I
    could do, and after a lot of trial & error...
    <br>
    <br>
    Boom! From virtual dust came Bible Type!

<h2>Inspirations + Thanks</h2>
<p>
    For those who are more inclined towards typing games,
    you may be thinking that it looks quite similar to
    <a href="https://monkeytype.com/">MonkeyType</a>, and
    that's because I was super inspired by it.
    <a href="https://monkeytype.com/">MonkeyType</a> is also a
    typing application which I looked towards for inspiration regarding UX design decisions such as cursor animations or
    decisions regarding different keys, so I highly
    encourage you to
    check it out if you want to see how a real typing app is
    implemented.

    I also want to thank <a href="https://github.com/seven1m">Tim Morgan</a>,
    the creator of <a href="https://github.com/seven1m/bible_api">bible-api.</a>
    Sometimes, the whole process of signing up for api keys and
    reading all the terms & service agreements can be a bit
    overwhelming, but thankfully Tim had created this really simple
    and easy-to-use api for us novice developers, so if you
    ever get a chance to see this Tim, thank you!
    <br>
    (Also encouraged by your work on Natalie, hopefully I can write
    a compiler soon as well!)
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Lastly, I just want to thank God for His faithfulness
    to me throughout the tumultuous year of 2020. It's
    been such a difficult year given the circumstances
    regarding COVID-19, social tensions, and just the
    ordinary lows of regular day-to-day life, but even writing
    this about page, heading into 2021, I feel so blessed
    knowing that I'm here in this present moment with you. Thank
    you for being my encouragement in moments I didn't want
    to complete this. Thank you for allowing me to hear Your
    word at <a href="https://www.crosscon.com/">CROSS20</a>, even though I didn't want even go at first.
    To be honest, evangelism wasn't my goal with this project, but
    I hope that you would use my ill intentions for Your glory.
